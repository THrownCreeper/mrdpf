\section{Remote Desktop Protocol}

The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used for communication between a terminal server and a terminal client \cite{deland-han_understanding_nodate}. The protocol only runs over TCP/IP. The protocol is used to remotely access systems running the Microsoft Windows operating system. For a more detailed and complete overview of the protocol, please refer to Microsoft’s documentation \cite{openspecs-office_ms-rdpbcgr_nodate}. 

\section{macOS RDP Client Application}

The Windows operating system ships with the built-in RDP client \textit{mstsc.exe}. This client creates various artifacts that can be analyzed to make determinations as to when connections were initiated, as well as certain information relating to user actions while remoted into a system. While no native RDP client exists on macOS, Microsoft has developed one and made it available on the Mac App Store \cite{noauthor_microsoft_nodate}. This client implemented the RDP protocol and can be used as a terminal client to remotely access Windows systems. Analyzing data stored on the system by this client can help in making determinations relating to a suspect’s use of the application to access remote Windows systems. This macOS RDP application will be further referred to as “Microsoft Remote Desktop” or “application”, not to be confused with \textit{mstsc.exe}.

\section{Available Forensic Artifacts}

As a Mac App Store applications, the Microsoft Remote Desktop application is forced to run in the App Sandbox \cite{noauthor_about_nodate}. Therefore, it’s configuration files and data stores can be found at the path \path{/Users/{Username}/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.rdc.macos}. Note that this folder will be referred to as \path{{base}} throughout the rest of this document.\\

\noindent Three major sources of artifacts are located within this folder:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \path{{base}/Data/Library/Application Support/com.microsoft.rdc.macos/com.microsoft.rdc.application-data.sqlite}
	\item \path{{base}/Data/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Remote Desktop/}
	\item \path{{base}/Data/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.rdc.macos.plist}
\end{enumerate}

Throughout the rest of this document the above sources will be referred to as {source1} through {source3}, or by their folder name. The remaining items in this section will outline various artifacts available within the above folders.

\subsection{1 — com.microsoft.rdc.application-data.sqlite}

This artifact is an SQLite \cite{noauthor_sqlite_nodate} database used to store various objects used by the application, including saved connections, gateways, and credentials. The following is an overview of the information contained within each table. As this table has a large number of columns, the detailed descriptions of all columns are available in the appendix.\\

\subsubsection{Z\_METADATA, Z\_MODELCACHE, Z\_PRIMARYKEY}

These tables contain data relating to the SQLite database format and were not analyzed in detail by the author.
\\

\subsubsection{ZBOOKMARKENTITY}

When a user adds a remote connection to the application, a corresponding entry is created in this table. The table will also contain a record of the most recently used “Quick Connect” connection initiated by the application. Note that when a new quick connection is attempted (regardless of whether or not it successfully establishes a connection), the QuickConnect row is updated and the previous data is lost.\\

\subsubsection{ZBOOKMARKFOLDERENTITY}

This table defines the bookmark folders a user can create in the application using the “Add Group” option.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{ZBOOKMARKFOLDERENTITY} - Columns}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}
Property              & Description                                                                                           \\ \hline
ZID                   & Unique ID (GUID) of this folder.                                                                      \\
ZTITLE                & The folder name displayed in the application.                                                        
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{ZBOOKMARKORDERENTITY}

This table defines the layout of bookmarks and bookmark folders on the main application window.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{ZBOOKMARKORDERENTITY} - Columns}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}
Property              & Description                                                                                           \\ \hline
ZROOT                & 
Binary PLIST detailing which folder each bookmark is contained in, as well as their order. The order of the folders themselves can also be determined. Note that this PLIST uses the ZID values of both bookmarks and folders instead of the SQLite Z\_PK identifiers.
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{ZCONNECTIONTIMEENTITY}

The author was not able to determine what purpose this table serves. None of the tests performed led to data being added to this table.\\

\subsubsection{ZCREDENTIALENTITY}

This table defines credentials stored by the user. These credentials can be used to bypass the default credential prompt that appears when a connection is attempted. A credential must have a username but must not necessarily have a password.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{ZCREDENTIALENTITY} - Columns}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}
Property      & Description                                                                  \\ \hline
ZNILPASSWORD  & 1 if no password is defined for this credential, 0 if a password is defined. \\
ZFRIENDLYNAME & The display name of the user. If not set, ZUSERNAME is used.                 \\
ZID           & Unique ID (GUID) of this credential.                                         \\
ZUSERNAME     & Username associated with this credential                                    
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A credential with the ZNILPASSWORD property set to 0 will have a corresponding entry in the login keychain. The keychain is a secure credential storage service built in to macOS \cite{noauthor_what_nodate}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{ZCREDENTIALENTITY} - Keychain Entry}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{ZGATEWAYENTITY}

This table tracks gateways configured by the user in the application’s preferences window. Each entry stores the gateway’s IP address as well as a friendly name and Z\_PK of the associated ZCREDENTIAL, if one is configured.\\

\subsubsection{ZGLOBALSETTINGSENTITY}

This table stores various global settings for the application. Many of these settings are configurable in the “General” tab of the application preferences pane.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{ZGLOBALSETTINGSENTITY} - Columns}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}

ZZOOMTHUMBNAIL- ONHOVER       & This property cannot be directly configured via the GUI and is always set to 1. Manually setting the property to 0 and restarting the application had no affect.                                     
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{ZLICENSEENTITY}

The author was not able to determine what purpose this table serves. None of the tests performed led to data being added to this table.\\

\subsubsection{ZREMOTERESOURCEENTITY}

The author was not able to determine what purpose this table serves. None of the tests performed led to data being added to this table.\\

\subsubsection{ZRESOLUTIONENTITY}

This table tracks the resolution options displayed in the application menu when adding a new remote connection.\\

\subsubsection{ZTRUSTENTITY}

The author was not able to determine what purpose this table serves. None of the tests performed led to data being added to this table.\\

\subsubsection{ZWORKSPACEENTITY}

The author was not able to determine what purpose this table serves. None of the tests performed led to data being added to this table. This is due to the fact that the author did not have access to a Remote Desktop Workspace, nor the ability to create one for testing purposes.\\

\subsubsection{Connection Thumbnails}

If enabled, when a connection to a remote host is successfully established, a thumbnail of the host screen contents will be shown in the application’s main window. While a connection is active, the thumbnail is refreshed every minute. Note that the thumbnail is not automatically refreshed upon closing an active connection, nor upon connecting to a bookmark that already has a thumbnail.

The author was unable to locate the storage location for connection thumbnails. This remains the primary and most important additional avenue of exploration given the forensic significance of having access to thumbnails of remote desktop activity.

\subsection{2 — Microsoft Remote Desktop/}

Two files of interest exist within this folder, both related to the application’s crash reporting telemetry system. They are created even if the user opts out of telemetry services at the time of first application launch.\\

\subsubsection{\{source2\}/FirstStartTime.dat}

This file begins with the signature “C3 0A 00 00”, followed by a GUID and a plaintext ISO 8601\cite{noauthor_iso_nodate} date in UTC. This date represents the first time the application was launched by the user on the system.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{FirstStartTime.dat} - Properties}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Offset & Length & Property      \\ \hline
0      & 4      & Header        \\
4      & 36     & GUID          \\
40     & 24     & ISO 8601 Date
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent
\subsubsection{\{source2\}/offlinestorageHigh.dat}

This file stores application crash reports and telemetry data. The data is periodically transmitted via a POST request to “https://in.appcenter.ms/logs?Api-Version=1.0.0” when telemetry services are enabled \cite{king-of-spades_upload_nodate} \cite{king-of-spades_app_nodate}. The file contains encoded parameters that are sent to the API. Each entry begins with the hex values “C1 0A 00 00 03 00 00 00” and ends with the hex values “D0 18 02 00”. A list of all parameters identified by the author can be found \href{https://jholtmann.github.io/mrdpf/\#mrdpf.parser\_definitions.OFFLINE\_STORAGE\_PARAMETERS'}{here}. Many of these properties are defined in the \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/privacy/required-diagnostic-data}{Microsoft documentation}.\\

Entries are periodically deleted from the file, presumably after they have been transmitted to Microsoft. Telemetry data is recorded to this file even when the “Help improve Remote Desktop” option is not selected.\\

Properties of interest include, but are not strictly limited to the following:
\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textit{offlineStorageHigh.dat} - Properties of Interest}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}
Property  						& Description \\ \hline
AppInfo.Version 					& Version of the application.                                                                                        \\	 
DeviceInfo.Model                                & The model name of the Apple computer (e.g. MacBookPro11,4).                                                        \\
DeviceInfo.OsVersion                          & The Operating System version (e.g. 10.15.6).                                                                       \\
EventInfo.Time                                   & ISO 8601 date/time the event took place.                                                                           \\
Session.FirstLaunchTime                     & First time the application was launched.                                                                           \\
UserInfo.TimeZone                                & System time zone.                                                                                                  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note that while a variety of other properties exist in the file, the author was not able to determine the purpose for all of them. The author confirmed that those properties with clear names contain the data that their names would indicate. However, the author was not able to determine the purpose of the following properties: \textit{S\_e, S\_j, S\_k, S\_p, S\_t, S\_v, r\_count, r\_inv, n\_r\_count, n\_r\_inv, n\_r\_inv}.\\

The \textit{EventInfo.Name} field defines the type of event being logged. The following event names were observed by the author:

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Observed Values for Property \textit{EventInfo.Name}}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Meaning}                                                                                            \\ \hline
applifecycle  & A record of the application lifecycle, see following section on the \textit{AppLifeCycle.State} property.          \\
session       &                                                                                                             \\
act\_stats    & This event has been observed occurring shortly prior to the recording of a \textit{session} event with the AppLifeCycle.State \textit{Launch}. The event is also observed upon application exit. Neither of the above patterns was consistent, however.
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent\textit{Application Usage Tracking via Sessions}\\

Analysis of properties with \textit{EventInfo.Name} matching \textit{session} allows for the determination of application usage information. When a user interacts with the application, a session entry is created with \textit{Session.State} set to \textit{Started}. A unique GUID \textit{Session.Id} is assigned and can be matched to a session entry with \textit{Session.State} set to \textit{Ended}. Said entry will have an entry for the property \textit{Session.Duration}, indicating the time in seconds for which the user interacted with the application. The \textit{Session.FirstLaunchTime} field does not change and is always set to the first launch time that can also be found in \textit{FirstStartTime.dat}.\\

\noindent\textit{Application Usage Tracking via AppLifeCycle.State}\\

When present, the property \textit{AppLifeCycle.State} can also be used to track usage of the application. Note that these entries are created much less reliably than \textit{session} entries. The following states were observed by the author:

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Observed Values for Property \textit{AppLifeCycle.State}}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\linewidth} | p{0.55\linewidth}}
\textbf{State Name} & \textbf{Meaning}                                            \\ \hline
Launch              & Application was opened from an exit state.                  \\
Exit                & Application was quit.                                       \\
Resume              & User interacted with the application after a suspend state (application is brought into focus). \\
Suspend             & The author was not able to determine the exact meaning of this state.     
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Launch events will sometimes have a GUID set in the Session.ID field. It is possible that this ID could be used to track a given session within the \textit{offlinestorageHigh.dat} events. The ID has been observed alongside Launch, Suspend, and Resume app lifecycle states. Note that the ID is not always present, and repeat Suspend events have been observed with varying Session IDs. More analysis is required for this avenue.\\

\section{Quick Reference}

\subsection{First Application Launch Time}

Reference section III-B1. The file \path{{source2}/offlinestorageHigh.dat} contains a ISO 8601 formatted date that represents the first time the application was launched.

\subsection{Saved Connections}

Reference section III-A2. The \textit{ZBOOKMARKENTITY} table tracks all saved connections. Information available includes hostname/IP address, last connection time, credential to be used, and more. Analysis of the SQLite WAL may reveal deleted connections and past connection history.

\subsection{Quick Connect Usage}

Reference section III-A2. The \textit{ZBOOKMARKENTITY} contains a row with \textit{ZID} ``QuickConnectBookmark'' which tracks information related to the last quick connect system. Note that this row does not exist if no quick connection attempt has been made. Analysis of the SQLite WAL may reveal past quick connection attempts. Note that the presence of this row in the table is not on its own indicative of the connection having succeeded.

\subsection{Application Usage}

Analysis of session events in the \path{{source2}/offlinestorageHigh.dat} file can be used to determine when, and for how long, a user interacted with the application.

\section{Accompanying Python Module}

This white paper is accompanied by a Python module named mRDPf \cite{noauthor_jholtmannmrdpf_nodate}. The Python module is capable of automatically  parsing all available data from sources 2 and 3. For source 1, the module dumps all SQLite tables once with inclusion of the WAL, and once without. For more detailed analysis of the WAL, a dedicated WAL-forensics tool should be used. See \href{https://jholtmann.github.io/mrdpf/}{this website} for complete documentation of the module as well as it's command line interface. See \href{https://github.com/jholtmann/mrdpf}{this GitHub repository} for the source code for both the Python module and this white paper.\\

The Python module can currently parse the following files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \path{com.microsoft.rdc.application-data.sqlite}
	\item \path{com.microsoft.rdc.macos.plist}
	\item \path{offlinestorageHigh.dat}
\end{itemize}

The following files/folders are generated in the tool’s output directory if all three of the above files are parsed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \path{DB_DUMP}: folder containing a dump of all tables in the SQLite database.
	\item \path{DB_BUMP_IGNORE_WAL}: folder containing a dump of all tables in the SQLite database when ignoring the presence of the corresponding WAL file.
	\item \path{bookmarks.csv}: a CSV file containing the data from ZBOOKMARKENTITY with the columns containing binary PLIST data parsed to json.
	\item \path{bookmark_order.csv}:  a CSV file containing the data from ZBOOKMARKORDERENTITY with the columns containing binary PLIST data parsed to json.
	\item \path{metadata.csv}:  a CSV file containing the data from Z\_METADATA with the columns containing binary PLIST data parsed to json.
	\item \path{offline_storage.csv}: a file containing parsed data from offlinestorageHigh.dat. If certain columns have secondary property names where a value is expected, please add said property to the OFFLINE\_STORAGE\_PARAMETERS array. The author could not determine a complete list of all properties possible in this artifact.
	\item \path{preferences_plist.json}: JSON representation of the binary PLIST \path{com.microsoft.rdc.macos.plist}
	\item \path{write_log.csv}: a CSV detailing all input files that matched compatible globs, as well as the path results from said file were written to and what parser was used.
\end{itemize}

\section{Avenues for Further Analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Locate storage location for connection thumbnails.
	\item Further analyze Microsoft telemetry system to determine if additional forensic insights can be gleamed.
	\item Perform tests involving RDP workspaces.
\end{enumerate}
